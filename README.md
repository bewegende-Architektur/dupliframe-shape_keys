# dupliframes with shape_keys and material
In previous versions of blender there was a tool called dupliframes.
This methode allowed users to duplicate an animated object at every frame. 
https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.79/editors/3dview/object/properties/duplication/dupliframes.html

This script is doing the same but with animated shape keys and materials too.

### Howto
* Set blender into scripting mode
* copy the code from dupli_frame_shape_key.py
* select one object to work with
* run the script
